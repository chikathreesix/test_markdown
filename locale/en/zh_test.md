## Webpacked

By default, [vue-loader](http://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/) automatically processes your style and template files with `css-loader` and the Vue template compiler. In this compilation process, all asset URLs such as `<img src="...">`, `background: url(...)` and CSS `@import` are resolved as module dependencies.
